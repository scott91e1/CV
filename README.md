## Early career

Scott has a long history of object oriented software development. Soon after leaving university completed his first commercial project, a graphical, interactive system designed to teach university level micro-economics. The book and software was published by Jacaranda-Wiley in 1995 as ISBN 0471336912.

His interest in large scale computer networks lead to a number of years of personal service contracting to the Australian federal government. Over a period of 5 years Scott applied his programming skills to solving network related problems in the Department of Social Security (DSS). In this large environment ( 400+ Servers, 20,000+ PCs ) many problems could be solved at a lower cost by developing programs to solve specific tasks.

BHP-IT was the prime contactor to DSS during the hundred million dollar network replacement project. Scott spent 2 year working with 3 other developers to implement an automated software distribution product for the NetWare / Windows environment.

Scott spent a year working for Novell in Australia in the role of Asia-Pacific developer support. During this time he used his board range of development experience to assist other developers with their own projects. His roles also involved trade show and running development seminars with 100+ developers.
